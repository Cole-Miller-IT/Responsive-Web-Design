    I initial was using grid layout for just my projects section but after watching a tutorial
    by Wes Bos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAO5hsNuGZA I decided to redesign the website 
    using grid layout for the projects and the main elements like nav, main, projects nad the footer.
    This allowed me to make the website responsive while focusing on just one layout.
    
    
    
    
    
    One of the things I learned is that css's grid layout 1fr isn't a fixed size. What I mean
    is that if you say 1fr but the contents overflow the 1fr it will take up more space
    than the 1fr you specified. I spent far to long trying to understand what was happening,
    but eventually found a solution thanks to stackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47601564/equal-width-columns-in-css-grid
    I quote "503
    
    The common answer of repeat(3, 1fr) is not quite correct.
    
    This is because 1fr is about the distribution of available(!) space. This breaks as soon as the content becomes bigger
    than the track size. By default, it does not overflow and adjust the column width accordingly. That's why not all 1fr
    are guaranteed to be of equal width. 1fr is actually rather just a shorthand for minmax(auto, 1fr).
    
    If you really need the columns to be the exact same width you should use:
    
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr));
    minmax(0, 1fr) allows the grid tracks to be as small as 0 but as large as 1fr, creating columns that will stay equal.
    But, be aware that this will cause overflows if the content is bigger than the column or cannot be wrapped."

    This man right here has saved me.

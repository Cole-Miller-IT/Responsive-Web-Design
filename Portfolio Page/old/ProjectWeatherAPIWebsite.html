    I had never worked with APIs before so I thought thiswould be a good project to try and tackle.
    The html and css are simple enough but using an API presented some issues. First was that the guide
    I was following was using a deprecated version of the api call so I had to finf the new url call.

    This wasn't that bad but something that I learned was that these functions were asyncronise, which makes perfect sense.
    But at the time I was confused for like 15 minutes on why the return statement was undefined. After
    looking at stackOverflow I worked out a solution and now I could get all of the data I wanted.

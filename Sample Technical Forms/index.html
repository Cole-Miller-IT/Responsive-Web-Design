                <p>A game engine is a complex tool and difficult to present in a few words. Here's a quick synopsis, which you are free to
                reuse if you need a quick write-up about Godot Engine:
                
                Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It
                provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the
                wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux,
                macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.
                
                Godot is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing.
                Users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
                community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the Godot
                Foundation not-for-profit.

                <header>Nodes</header>
                <p>You can get a reference to a node by calling the Node.get_node() method. For this to work, the child node must be
                present in the scene tree. Getting it in the parent node's _ready() function guarantees that.
                
                If, for example, you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get a reference to the Sprite2D and Camera2D nodes to
                access them in your script.

                <header>Scenes</header>
                    <p>When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new
                    node types in the editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, the instance of the scene
                    appears as a single node with its internals hidden.
                    
                    Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can compose nodes to create custom and complex node
                    types, like a game character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can interact, and more.

                    <p>GDScript is a high-level, object-oriented, imperative, and gradually typed programming language built for Godot. It uses
                    an indentation-based syntax similar to languages like Python. Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated
                    with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content creation and integration.
                    
                    GDScript is entirely independent from Python and is not based on it.

                    <p>When working on the Godot editor keep in mind that by default the executable will start in the Project Manager mode.
                    Opening a project from the Project Manager spawns a new process, which stops the debugging session. To avoid that you
                    should launch directly into the project using -e and --path launch options.
                    </p>

                <header>Signals</header>
                <p>In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit when something specific happens to them, like
                a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs.
                
                Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game object to react to a change in another without
                them referencing one another. Using signals limits coupling and keeps your code flexible.
                
                For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the player's health. When the player takes damage
                or uses a healing potion, you want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use signals.
                </p>

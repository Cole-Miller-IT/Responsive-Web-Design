                <p>A game engine is a complex tool and difficult to present in a few words. Here's a quick synopsis, which you are free to
                reuse if you need a quick write-up about Godot Engine:
                
                Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It
                provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the
                wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux,
                macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.
                
                Godot is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing.
                Users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
                community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the Godot
                Foundation not-for-profit.

                <code>
                    get_tree().create_timer(2)
                </code>
                <ul>

                    documentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every game engine revolves around abstractions you use to build your applications. In Godot, a game is a tree of nodes
                that you group together into scenes. You can then wire these nodes so they can communicate using signals.
                
                These are the four concepts you will learn here. We're going to look at them briefly to give you a sense of how the
                engine works. In the getting started series, you will get to use them in practice.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Nodes">
                <header>Nodes</header>
                <p>Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A
                given node can contain any number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct children of a
                node) should have unique names.</p>
                <p>You can get a reference to a node by calling the Node.get_node() method. For this to work, the child node must be
                present in the scene tree. Getting it in the parent node's _ready() function guarantees that.
                
                If, for example, you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get a reference to the Sprite2D and Camera2D nodes to
                access them in your script.
                </p>
                <code>
                    var tween = create_tween()
                </code>
                <p>The last characteristic is important. Together, nodes form a tree, which is a powerful feature to organize projects.
                Since different nodes have different functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, you can
                build a playable character the camera follows using a CharacterBody2D node, a Sprite2D node, a Camera2D node, and a
                CollisionShape2D node.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Scenes">
                <header>Scenes</header>
                    <p>When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new
                    node types in the editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, the instance of the scene
                    appears as a single node with its internals hidden.
                    
                    Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can compose nodes to create custom and complex node
                    types, like a game character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can interact, and more.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <p>func _on_timer_timeout():</p>
                        <p>visible = not visible</p>
                    </code>
                    <p>Scene tree: The SceneTree contains the active tree of nodes. When a node is added to the scene tree, it receives the
                    NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE notification and its _enter_tree callback is triggered. Child nodes are always added after their
                    parent node, i.e. the _enter_tree callback of a parent node will be triggered before its child's.
                    
                    Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the NOTIFICATION_READY notification and their respective
                    _ready callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the _ready callback is called in reverse order, starting with the
                    children and moving up to the parent nodes.
                    
                    This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order will be used for the callbacks: _enter_tree of
                    the parent, _enter_tree of the children, _ready of the children and finally _ready of the parent (recursively for the
                    entire scene tree).
                    </p>

                <header>Scripts</header>
                    <p>GDScript is a high-level, object-oriented, imperative, and gradually typed programming language built for Godot. It uses
                    an indentation-based syntax similar to languages like Python. Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated
                    with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content creation and integration.
                    
                    GDScript is entirely independent from Python and is not based on it.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <p>var a # 'null' by default.</p>
                        <p>a = 5 # Valid, 'a' becomes an integer.</p>
                        <p>a = "Hi!" # Valid, 'a' changed to a string.</p>
                    </code>
                    <p>This, translated to reality, means that Godot used with GDScript is a combination designed to create games quickly and
                    efficiently. For games that are very computationally intensive and can't benefit from the engine built-in tools (such as
                    the Vector types, Physics Engine, Math library, etc), the possibility of using C++ is present too. This allows you to
                    still create most of the game in GDScript and add small bits of C++ in the areas that need a performance boost.

                <header>Debugging</header>
                    <p>When working on the Godot editor keep in mind that by default the executable will start in the Project Manager mode.
                    Opening a project from the Project Manager spawns a new process, which stops the debugging session. To avoid that you
                    should launch directly into the project using -e and --path launch options.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <p>extends Sprite2D</p>
                        
                        <p>var speed = 400</p>
                        <p>var angular_speed = PI</p>
                    </code>
                    <p>You can learn more about these launch options and other command line arguments in the command line tutorial.

                    process for building and debugging with your particular editor.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Signals">
                <header>Signals</header>
                <p>In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit when something specific happens to them, like
                a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs.
                
                Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game object to react to a change in another without
                them referencing one another. Using signals limits coupling and keeps your code flexible.
                
                
                </p>
                <code>
                func _ready():
                var timer = get_node("Timer")
                timer.timeout.connect(_on_timer_timeout)
                
                
                func _process(delta):
                rotation += angular_speed * delta
                var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed
                position += velocity * delta
                
                
                func _on_button_pressed():
                set_process(not is_processing())
                
                
                
                </code>
                <p>For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the player's health. When the player takes damage
                or uses a healing potion, you want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use signals.</p>
